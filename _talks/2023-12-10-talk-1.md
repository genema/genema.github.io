Temporal Conditioning Spiking Latent Variable Models of the Neural Response to Natural Visual Scenes
-----
BY Gehua Ma, Runhao Jiang, Rui Yan, and Huajin Tang

[NeurIPS 2023] Developing computational models of neural response is crucial for sensory neuroscience.However, most existing models employ an unnatural processing paradigm.This work introduces a tool which is able to perform computation in a **natural paradigm** like real neural circuits.
