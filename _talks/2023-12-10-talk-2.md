**Temporal Conditioning Spiking Latent Variable Models of the Neural Response to Natural Visual Scenes**

BY Gehua Ma

Developing computational models of neural response is crucial for sensory neuroscience.However, most existing models employ an unnatural processing paradigm. This work introduces a tool which is able to perform computation in a **natural paradigm** like real neural circuits.
